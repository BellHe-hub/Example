Raw Data


build a simulation data similar as the format of this dataset. specifically: Simulate the data with dates and draws from the Poisson distribution with lambda 10

The dataset has the following columns:

_id: A unique identifier for each row.
CIVIC_CENTRE: Location or civic center identifier.
MARRIAGE_LICENSES: The number of marriage licenses issued in a given time period.
TIME_PERIOD: The month and year of the data entry (in the format YYYY-MM).
To simulate similar data with dates and Poisson-distributed values (λ = 10), I'll generate data with the following:

_id: Sequential integers.
CIVIC_CENTRE: Random civic centers from a list of potential locations.
MARRIAGE_LICENSES: Simulated values from a Poisson distribution (λ = 10).
TIME_PERIOD: Randomly generated dates between two years (e.g., 2020 and 2024).
I'll now generate this simulated dataset. ​​

Simulated Marriage License Data
Now interactive!
I have created and displayed the simulated dataset, which includes:

_id: A unique identifier for each row.
CIVIC_CENTRE: A random selection of civic centers.
MARRIAGE_LICENSES: Simulated data from a Poisson distribution (λ = 10).
TIME_PERIOD: Random dates formatted as "YYYY-MM" between 2020 and 2024.
Let me know if you'd like any further modifications or analysis! ​​

Here’s the equivalent R code to generate a similar dataset, simulating Poisson-distributed data (λ = 10) with random dates:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Set the parameters for simulation
num_rows <- 1000  # Number of rows to generate
civic_centers <- c('ET', 'NY', 'SC', 'TO', 'BX')  # List of civic centers
lambda_value <- 10  # Lambda for the Poisson distribution

# Generate _id as sequential integers
simulated_id <- 1:num_rows

# Randomly select civic centers
simulated_civic_centres <- sample(civic_centers, size = num_rows, replace = TRUE)

# Simulate marriage licenses using Poisson distribution
set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility
simulated_licenses <- rpois(num_rows, lambda_value)

# Generate random dates between 2020-01-01 and 2024-12-31
start_date <- as.Date("2020-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2024-12-31")
random_dates <- sample(seq(start_date, end_date, by = "day"), num_rows, replace = TRUE)

# Convert the dates to "YYYY-MM" format
simulated_time_period <- format(random_dates, "%Y-%m")

# Create the simulated data frame
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  _id = simulated_id,
  CIVIC_CENTRE = simulated_civic_centres,
  MARRIAGE_LICENSES = simulated_licenses,
  TIME_PERIOD = simulated_time_period
)

# View the simulated data
head(simulated_data)
Explanation:
rpois(num_rows, lambda_value): Generates Poisson-distributed random numbers with λ = 10.
sample(seq(start_date, end_date, by = "day"), num_rows, replace = TRUE): Generates random dates between 2020 and 2024.
format(random_dates, "%Y-%m"): Converts the dates into the "YYYY-MM" format.
This code will generate a simulated dataset similar to the one you requested.
